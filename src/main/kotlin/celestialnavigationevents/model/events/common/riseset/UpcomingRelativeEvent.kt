/**
 * Represents the next upcoming astronomical event with a relative time offset from the current moment.
 *
 * Includes the local time of the event within the day ([Time]), azimuth angle, and the duration
 * in milliseconds until the event occurs.
 *
 * Suitable for countdowns, visual interfaces, or any scenario where relative timing is needed.
 * Designed for use with any astronomical body such as the Sun or Moon.
 *
 * @property type The type of the astronomical event (e.g., rise or set).
 * @property azimuth The azimuth angle at which the event occurs, in degrees.
 * @property time The local time of day when the event is expected.
 * @property timeToNearestEventMillis Time in milliseconds from the current moment until the event.
