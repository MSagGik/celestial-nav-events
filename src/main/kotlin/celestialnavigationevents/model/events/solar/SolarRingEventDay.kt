/**
 * Represents solar time segments for a given day associated with a specific solar ring event,
 * such as the magic hour, blue hour, or twilight phases.
 *
 * This class provides both the main event intervals (e.g., twilight periods) and
 * aggregate durations for the remaining parts of the day outside of those intervals.
 *
 * @property events A list of time intervals representing the target solar event (e.g., blue hour, magic hour).
 * @property daylightBeforeRing Total duration of daylight before the first event interval begins.
 * @property ringDuration Total duration of all event intervals combined (e.g., sum of morning and evening blue hour).
 * @property darknessAfterRing Total duration of nighttime after the last event interval ends.
