/**
 * Data structure representing corrections applied to astronomical calculations
 * related to the rising and setting of celestial bodies (e.g., Sun and Moon).
 *
 * @property angleFromHorizon The angular offset from the horizon in degrees.
 * This value adjusts the calculated position of the celestial body relative to the horizon,
 * where negative values represent positions below the horizon and positive values above it.
 *
 * @property isAtmosphericRefractionIncluded Indicates whether atmospheric refraction
 * should be taken into account when calculating the position of the celestial body.
