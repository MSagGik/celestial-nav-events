/**
 * Represents a collection of lunar events and related characteristics for a given day,
 * expressed in relative terms (e.g., relative time intervals or phases).
 *
 * @property events List of upcoming lunar events with relative timing information.
 * @property type The current horizon crossing state of the Moon (e.g., risen, set, both, or none).
 * @property preType The previous horizon crossing state, useful for detecting transitions.
 * @property visibleLength Duration of the Moon's visibility during the day, if calculable.
 * @property invisibleLength Duration of the Moon's invisibility during the day, if calculable.
 * @property meridianCrossing Approximate time when the Moon crosses the local meridian (highest point).
 * @property antimeridianCrossing Approximate time when the Moon crosses the antimeridian (lowest point).
 * @property ageInDays Lunar age in days since the last new moon, useful for phase determination.
 * @property illuminationPercent Percentage of the Moon's visible surface illuminated by the Sun (0.0 to 100.0).
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if [illuminationPercent] is not within 0.0 to 100.0 inclusive.
 *
 * Use [getDefaultLunarRelativeEventDay] to create an instance with empty events and default values.
