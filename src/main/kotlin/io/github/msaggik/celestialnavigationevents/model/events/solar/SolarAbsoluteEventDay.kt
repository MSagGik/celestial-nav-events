/**
 * Represents a day containing absolute astronomical events for a celestial body,
 * where each event includes a concrete date and time.
 *
 * Suitable for use cases requiring time references for future horizon crossings,
 * such as sunrise or sunset.
 *
 * @property events A list of horizon crossing events (e.g., rise/set) with absolute date and time.
 * @property type The overall horizon crossing state for this day
 *                (e.g., polar day, polar night, normal cycle).
 * @property preType The horizon crossing state of the previous day, useful for context (e.g., transition from polar night).
 * @property dayLength The total duration of daylight, if applicable.
 * @property nightLength The total duration of nighttime, if applicable.
 * @property meridianCrossing The time when the celestial body crosses the local meridian (culmination).
 * @property antimeridianCrossing The time when the body crosses the antimeridian (lowest point).
