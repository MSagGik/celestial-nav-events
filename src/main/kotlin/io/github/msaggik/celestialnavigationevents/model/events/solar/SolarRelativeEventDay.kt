/**
 * Represents a day containing relative astronomical events for a celestial body,
 * where each event is expressed relative to a specified reference time (e.g., now).
 *
 * Suitable for determining time-to-event values for scheduling or countdowns.
 *
 * @property events A list of horizon crossing events (e.g., rise/set) with relative time offsets.
 * @property type The overall horizon crossing state for this day.
 * @property preType The horizon crossing state of the previous day, useful for detecting transitions.
 * @property dayLength The total duration of daylight, if applicable.
 * @property nightLength The total duration of nighttime, if applicable.
 * @property meridianCrossing The time when the celestial body reaches its highest point in the sky.
 * @property antimeridianCrossing The time when the body reaches the lowest point below the horizon.
