 * Suitable as a raw or intermediate structure for solar event modeling.
 *
 * @property events A list of rise and set events for the day.
 * @property type The overall horizon crossing state (e.g., normal day, polar night).
 * @property dayLength The duration of visible time, if applicable.
 * @property nightLength The duration of invisible time, if applicable.
 * @property meridianCrossing The time when the body crosses the local meridian.
 * @property antimeridianCrossing The time when the body crosses the antimeridian.
