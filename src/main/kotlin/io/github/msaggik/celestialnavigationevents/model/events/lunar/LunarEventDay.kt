/**
 * Represents a complete set of lunar horizon crossing events and related properties
 * for a specific calendar day.
 *
 * In addition to rise and set times, includes moon-specific characteristics such as
 * phase progression and illumination, making it suitable for both astronomical
 * analysis and visual planning.
 *
 * @property events A list of lunar horizon crossing events (e.g., moonrise and moonset).
 * @property type The overall horizon crossing state for the Moon on this day
 *                (e.g., always above horizon, always below, or standard rise/set).
 * @property visibleLength The total duration during which the Moon is above the horizon.
 * @property invisibleLength The total duration during which the Moon is below the horizon.
 * @property meridianCrossing The time when the Moon crosses the local meridian (culmination).
 * @property antimeridianCrossing The time when the Moon crosses the antimeridian (lowest point).
 * @property ageInDays The number of days since the last new moon (lunar age).
 * @property illuminationPercent The percentage of the Moonâ€™s visible surface that is illuminated (0..100).
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if [illuminationPercent] is not in the range 0..100 inclusive.
