/**
 * A lightweight representation of the next upcoming astronomical event using relative timing.
 *
 * Provides only the event type and the time offset in milliseconds from the current moment.
 * Ideal for simplified scheduling, reminders, or fast computations where full event context is unnecessary.
 *
 * Can be used for any celestial object such as the Sun, Moon, or other astronomical bodies.
 *
 * @property eventType The type of the upcoming event (e.g., rise or set).
 * @property timestampMillis Time in milliseconds from now until the event occurs.
