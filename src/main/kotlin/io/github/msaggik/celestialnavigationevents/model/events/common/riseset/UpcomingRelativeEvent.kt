 * Designed for use with any astronomical body such as the Sun or Moon.
 *
 * @property type The type of the astronomical event (e.g., rise or set).
 * @property azimuth The azimuth angle at which the event occurs, in degrees.
 * @property time The local time of day when the event is expected.
 * @property timeToNearestEventMillis Time in milliseconds from the current moment until the event.
