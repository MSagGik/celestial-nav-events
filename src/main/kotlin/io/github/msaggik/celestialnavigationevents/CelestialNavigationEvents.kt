/**
 * Entry point and factory for accessing unified solar and lunar astronomical event calculations.
 *
 * This class acts as a facade and factory for accessing [CelestialEventsCalculator],
 * which provides methods to compute solar and lunar events.
 *
 * ## Design Patterns
 * - **Factory Pattern**: Instantiates and returns a unified calculator.
 * - **Facade Pattern**: Hides the complexity of the underlying implementations.
 *
 * ## Example
 * ```kotlin
 * val celestial = CelestialNavigationEvents().provide()
 * val sunEvent = celestial.solar().calculateSolarEventDay(...)
 * val moonEvent = celestial.lunar().calculateLunarEventDay(...)
 * ```
