 * Container for the result of an astronomical event computation.

 *
 * @property events List of detected astronomical events (e.g., sunrise, moonset).
 * @property verticalPosition Final vertical position of the celestial body
 *           at the end of the evaluated time interval. Used for continuity in
 *           subsequent calculations.
