/**
 * Represents a range of angular corrections used to define the bounds of a solar event interval.
 *
 * Used for calculating intervals like blue hour, twilight phases, or magic hour,
 * where the event is bounded by two angular positions of the Sun relative to the horizon.
 *
 * @property lowerHorizonCorrection The lower bound of the angular range (typically more negative).
 * @property upperHorizonCorrection The upper bound of the angular range (closer to or above horizon).
 * @property typeEventTrack The semantic label indicating the nature of the interval
 * (e.g., CIVIL_TWILIGHT, MAGIC_HOUR).
