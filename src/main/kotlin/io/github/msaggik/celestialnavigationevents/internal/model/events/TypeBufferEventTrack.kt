/**
 * Enum representing the buffer track type for solar elevation thresholds in event detection.

 * - [LOWER]: Events at the lower solar elevation threshold (e.g., horizon crossings).
 * - [UPPER]: Events at the upper solar elevation threshold (e.g., civil twilight).
 *
 * Used to differentiate and pair events from different elevation levels when building solar event intervals.
