# üåå celestial-nav-events (CelestialNavigationEvents)

**CelestialNavigationEvents** is a lightweight library written in Kotlin for calculating common Sun and Moon events ‚Äî including sunrise, sunset, twilight phases, moonrise, moonset, lunar phases (in days), illumination, and more. It works offline worldwide using only geographic coordinates and time in the Java standard `ZonedDateTime` format.

## üìñ Overview

CelestialNavigationEvents solves everyday needs for applications that react to or display daily astronomical events. Typical scenarios include:

- üîÜ Dynamic day/night backgrounds in apps
- üì∏ Photography planning (magic hour / blue hour)
- üåë Night mode scheduling
- üåä Tide and weather forecasting tools
- üß≠ Hiking/navigation planners
- üóì Calendar integrations
- üåì Enhancing user experience with light/dark theme transitions

All calculations run locally; no internet connection is required.

## üì¶ Installation

### Using JitPack

1. In your project `settings.gradle` (or `settings.gradle.kts`):

   ```kotlin
   dependencyResolutionManagement {
       repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
       repositories {
           mavenCentral()
           maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
       }
   }
   ```

2. In your module `build.gradle` (or `build.gradle.kts`):

   ```kotlin
   dependencies {
       implementation("com.github.MSagGik:celestial-nav-events:1.0.0-beta2")
   }
   ```

---

## ‚ú® Quick Start

```kotlin
fun main() {
  val celestial = CelestialNavigationEvents().provide()

  val solarEvents = celestial.solar().calculateSolarEventDay(
    latitude = 12.345,
    longitude = 12.345,
    dateTime = java.time.ZonedDateTime.now()
  )
  println("Sunrise & Sunset: ${solarEvents.events}")

  val lunarEvents = celestial.lunar().calculateLunarEventDay(
    latitude = 12.345,
    longitude = 12.345,
    dateTime = java.time.ZonedDateTime.now()
  )
  println("Moonrise & Moonset: ${lunarEvents.events}")
  println("Lunar illumination: ${lunarEvents.illuminationPercent}%")
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Calculations are approximate and intended for general-purpose use.

## üöÄ Accuracy Disclaimer

This library offers **practical, non-scientific precision** intended for general-purpose JVM-based applications such as:

- Photography & golden hour planning
- Night mode or UI theming
- Basic navigation tools
- General-purpose mobile & desktop apps

üî¨ About Accuracy
- Based on widely recognized approximations from scientific literature
- Optimized for mid-latitude regions
- Accuracy may vary due to:
  - Observer elevation
  - Atmospheric pressure & temperature
  - Nearby obstructions (horizon profile)

Not intended or recommended for:
- Scientific research or precision-demanding simulations
- Professional astronomical observatories or ephemeris services
- Mission-critical, safety-related, or real-time systems

‚úÖ Design Highlights
- Fully offline & local computation
- Original implementation ‚Äî no direct reuse of third-party code
- Sources cited for transparency (see above)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The algorithms offer the highest precision in mid- and low-latitude regions. In polar areas, edge cases such as short twilight durations or low-angle transitions may involve approximations.
> While precision is sufficient for general-purpose applications, this library is not intended for scientific research or mission-critical systems.
>
